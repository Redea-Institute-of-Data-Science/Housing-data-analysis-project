# Housing data analysis project
This repository contains an assignment for training purposes.

We assume the role of a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Our task is to analyze and predict housing prices using attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and other relevant features. This assignment template provides a starting point for the analysis.

We basically create different scenarios where we complete the overall data analysis process. From loading data, cleaning/manipulation of data, exploratory data analysis, data modeling and communication of results
